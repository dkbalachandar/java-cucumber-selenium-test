Getting Started:

1. Download the repository
2. Download the 'gecko' driver from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases and copy it into '/usr/local/bin/'
3. Do 'mvn clean install'
4. Maven builds the test class and runs it. We can also run the test case(YelpTest.java) from any IDE as normal Junit test case.
